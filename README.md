**USA Accident Dataset Analysis from 2016-2023**
=====================================

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the USA Accident Dataset, performed in a Jupyter Notebook (`01-EDA.ipynb`).

**Introduction**
---------------

This analysis aims to explore and understand the USA Accident Dataset, which contains information about accidents that occurred in the United States. The goal is to gain insights into the dataset and identify trends, patterns, and correlations.

**Dataset**
------------

The USA Accident Dataset is used for this analysis. The dataset contains information about accidents that occurred in the United States, including data on the location, date, time, and other relevant factors.

**Analysis**
-------------

The analysis is performed in the `01-EDA.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, which contains the following sections:

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**: Import the dataset and perform necessary cleaning and preprocessing steps.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of variables, identify trends, and detect correlations.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the data to gain insights into the relationships between variables.
4. **Insights and Recommendations**: Summarize the findings and provide recommendations based on the analysis.

**Results**
------------

The results of the analysis are presented in the `01-EDA.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, which includes:

* Data visualizations
* Summary statistics
* Insights and recommendations

**Repository Structure**
